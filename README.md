# "Glocal" Strategy Checklist

A self-assessment tool to help businesses evaluate their "glocal" (global + local) strategy across different operational areas.

## üåç Project Overview

The "Glocal" Strategy Checklist is a web application designed to help businesses navigate the complex balance between global standardization and local adaptation. This tool presents users with a series of questions about their approach to various business functions (marketing, product development, customer service, etc.) and provides actionable insights on whether they may be over-standardizing or over-localizing.

### Target Users
- International businesses expanding to new markets
- Multinational corporations reviewing their regional strategies
- Marketing and strategy executives
- Consultants working with global clients

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multi-section assessment questionnaire** with targeted questions about standardization vs. localization
- **Visual representation of results** showing a balance score for each business function
- **Recommendations report** with specific insights on potential improvements
- **Save/export functionality** for sharing results with stakeholders
- **Mobile-responsive design** for on-the-go strategy assessment

## üí° Business Value

This tool addresses a critical challenge for global organizations: finding the right balance between consistent global brand identity and relevant local adaptation. Too much standardization can make a business irrelevant in local markets, while too much localization can lead to brand fragmentation and operational inefficiencies.
